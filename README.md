# InkuBOX
Creating the InkuBOX was a project we realised in the Makerspace at the TUM School of Life Sciences in Weihenstephan.
We came up with the idea to build a cheap incubator for studying plant-pathogen interactions without contaminating surrounding plants / apperations in the lab / growth chamber.
We descided to follow a modular system and tried to combine modules that are enclosed in themselfes for easy repair / adaption / modulation.
After intensive planning and debating of probable difficulties we started to construct our first prototype.
The control system is realized via the open source arduino platform.
Special parts were designed with AutoDesk360 and printed in PLA with a 3D-Printer.
The project tought us how difficult it can be to develop hardware and how much know how is hidden in every little aspect of even such a small and simple machine. 
We very quicly realized that changing one parameter always influences the whole project. 
We learned how to plan efficiently and what has to be considered if changes in the planing have to be implemented at a later stage.
Every single part of the machine influences the others which can be frustrating but in the end, thats what makes the product work.
This project still has lots of opportunities to be further enhanced and could sometime become the blueprint for a cheap and easy to assable phytochamber for laboratories all around the world.
We hope you find some inspiration through this project and feel free to contact us for any questions.
Starting with the InkuBOX.ptx you will most likely understand the project, even if you do not speak german.
